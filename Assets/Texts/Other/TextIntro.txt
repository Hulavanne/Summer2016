Once upon a time, there was a boy called Cieran.
In his head, there was nothing. Where yesterday had been, only a dark hole was left.
His mind in a haze, Cieran woke up and opened his eyes.
He was in his room. He had slept on his bed fully clothed. Why, he knew not.
Tried as he might, he couldn't recall what happened. From when he'd woken up yesterday, everything was a blur.

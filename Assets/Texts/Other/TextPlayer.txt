Cieran held the red berries in his hand, looking at their warm and lively shade. Eat a few?

(If yes)
He put a few berries into his mouth and ate them. Their taste was sweet and mellow, albeit a little bitter.
Almost right away Cieran started to feel really sick. His belly aching greatly, his eyes blear and his legs feeling as heavy as lead, he fell to his knees.
(The screen fades to black.)
Cieran felt sick on the ground, his heart beating too fast. Once his belly was empty, he fell on his nose and would not wake up.
Out cold and lying on his own sick, his arms and legs bloomed with red rash. Soon, he gave his last breath and alas, Cieran was no more.

(If no)
After a good look, he put the berries back into his pocket. He knew the berries of lilies of the valley were deadly, as he wasnâ€™t dumb.

When Cieran got far enough from the cave, the Fairy had stopped following him. Cieran sighed and tried to keep his hopes up.
But as wonderful as him getting eaten would have sounded, it was alright. It was time for me to come into play at last, so there was more to come for him.

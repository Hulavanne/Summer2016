Ah, there was the way out. But Cieran was not going through, I made sure of that.
He had withheld the truth. He stayed in denial and tried to run off.
But I made sure he could not get away. For I, the Witch, had him in my grasp.

But he would not get away.

Ah, there was the way out. Freedom was within his grasp. After all, he did finally look at the truth dead in the eye.
Poor little Cieran’s mother and father couldn’t afford to feed him much longer. He heard them whisper in the kitchen at night, plotting to kill him.
So little Cieran went and picked some berries of deadly nightshade and put them into his mother’s soup pot when she wasn’t looking.
He went to his room and cried while he heard them dying in the kitchen. In the end, he hid them in the closet so he wouldn’t have to look at them anymore.
He then grabbed their savings and put them into his toy box, ready for leaving alone for a new life.
This would not do. I was hungry and my game was bad children. Murder isn’t something a child like Cieran should take part in.
But he did it. And he faced it here.
So, leave. Go live alone, with no money and no hope. Live.
And he lived happily ever after.
Or not.

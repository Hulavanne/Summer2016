A deerlet lay on the ground. It breathed heavily and looked rather sad.
Suddenly, it spoke to Cieran:
“Oh, a small man. Hello. Good timing, by the way, I’ve something a man could really help me with,” it said. Its speech was raspy, being a struggle to utter.
“I’ve lost my mother and I need something that will let me see her. Ahead, there’s a patch of blooms pushing ripe berries. Can you bring me some? I can see her again with their help.”
Cieran knew not whether he should be more scared because the little deer had no eyes or because it could talk, so he kept his mouth shut instead.

The deerlet lay on the ground, breathing heavily and waiting.
“If you were so kind as to bring me a few berries, I would be very glad,” it said weakly. Cieran did his best not to stare at the deer’s face.

As Cieran handed over the berries, the deer’s face lit up to a smile with hope. It was hard for Cieran to make out, but the smile was there.
“Thank you very much, small man!” the deer said happily. “Now I can see my mother at last!”
"Do have this," it said as it handed Cieran a white toadstool. "I've nothing else to pay with, so I hope this will do."

"Oh mother, am I glad you're here again! cried the deer, rambling on by itself. "With the help of these berries I could see you again!"

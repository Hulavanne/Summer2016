Once upon a time, there was a boy called Cieran.
He lived with his mother and father in a small house in the woods, away from the town. They had little, but they had each other.
Then, one day, Cieran woke up to an awful headache.
He was in his room. He had slept on his bed fully clothed. Why, he knew not.
His head in a haze, Cieran got up and wondered what to do that day.

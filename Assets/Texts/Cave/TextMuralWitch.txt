A drawing of a witch hung on the cave wall. Below it was written:
“Once upon a Time, there was a Witch unbeaten. She loved to hunt and her Game was Children.”
“With her Familiar, the Fairy, on her Side, nothing stood in her Way. From the easiest to the hardest, she struck her Prey.”
A drawing of a boy hung on the cave wall. Below it was written:
“Her first Prey was Drest the Pest. For Lust tore he Legs off Spiders, so she tore his Heart from his Chest.”

A deerlet lay on the ground. It breathed heavily and looked rather sad.
Suddenly, it spoke to Cieran:
“Oh, a small man! Hello! Good timing, by the way, I’ve something a man could really help me with,” it said. Its speech was raspy, being a struggle to utter, but it did its best to look happy.
“I’ve lost my mother and I need something that will let me see her. Ahead, there’s a patch of blooms pushing ripe berries. Can you bring me some? I can see her again with their help.”
Cieran knew not whether he should be more scared because the little deer had no eyes or because it could talk, so he kept his mouth shut instead.

The deerlet lay on the ground, breathing heavily and waiting.
“If you were so kind as to bring me a few berries, I would be very glad,” it said through a wek smile. Cieran did his best not to stare at the deer’s face.

As Cieran handed over the berries, the deer’s face lit up to a smile with hope. It was hard for Cieran to make it out, but the smile was there.
“Ah, the berries! Thank you very much, small man!” the deer said happily. “Now I can see my mother at last!”
“Do have this,” it said as it handed Cieran a white toadstool. “I’ve nothing else to pay with, so I hope this will do.”

Swiftly, it pushed the berries onto its face, forming rough, red eyes.
“I can see!” it cried in glee. “I can see! And I can see HER! You’re here again at last, mother! I’ve waited so long...”
The deer talked on and on to its mother. Cieran was rather unnerved looking at the deerlet ramble to something that was not there.
Before he could leave, the deer turned back to him and said:
“Do be wary if you go that way again though. The Fairy is very fond of children. As meat.”
And as if nothing had happened, the deerlet went back to talking to itself.

"Oh mother, am I glad you're here again!" cried the deer, rambling on by itself. "With the help of these berries I can see you again at last!"

At the cave mouth sat a lone bear. Its eyes looked empty and its breath was heavy, uneven and loud. Some drool was slipping off its lower… lip.
It tried to speak with its melted mouth, just and just getting out a few words:
“...h-helw… h-h-hood… kill weeee...”
Cieran shivered and tried not to stare at the bear’s maw. He was out of words, so he gulped and tried to stay calm.

The bear sat still, knowing hardly anything of what was around it and rambling about food.

Cieran tried to give the bear the red berries but it didn’t seem to understand this. The berries just rolled away from the folds of its maw.
Cieran picked the berries back up again and tried to think of what else he could give to it.

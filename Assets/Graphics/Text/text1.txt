Once upon a time, there was a boy called Cieran.
In his head, there was nothing. Where yesterday had been, only a dark hole remained.
His mind in a hazem Cieran woke up and opened his eyes.
He was in his room. He had slept on his bed fully clothed. Why, he knew not.
Tried as he might, he could not recall what happened. From when he had woken up yesterday, everything was a blur.

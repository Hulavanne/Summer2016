Cieran’s room was ransacked with the doorway being blocked by his toy box and bookshelf.
The toy box was still locked as always, but a corner had burst open, littered with splinters too sharp to touch with bare hands.

With the help of his gloves, Cieran reached into the box through the corner… and grabbed a small box of coins from it.
Ah, that’s where it was hidden. Smart little brat. At least his gloves were now tattered.

He must have been glad, now that he had the money. But it wouldn’t shield him.

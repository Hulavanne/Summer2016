There was a drawing of a witch and a boy on the cave wall. Below it was written:
“Once upon a Time, there was a Witch unbeaten. She loved to hunt and her Game was Children.”
“With her Familiar, the Fairy, on her Side, nothing stood in her Way. From the easiest to the hardest, she struck her Prey.”
“Her first Prey was Aedan the Layman. He felt School was not for him, so her Fire made him ashen.”
